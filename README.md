                    Introduction: 
                    
A Tutor sphere portal is a web-based platform that allows students to search for and connect 
with qualified tutors and mentors from around the world. The portal operates by providing a 
database of tutors and mentors who have created profiles highlighting their qualifications, 
experience, and areas of expertise.
Students can use the portal to search for the right tutor or mentor based on their specific 
needs, such as subject, location, and availability. The platform provides an easy and efficient 
way for students to find and connect with a qualified tutor or mentor who can help them 
achieve their academic or personal goals.

                    Problem Statement: 
                    
Physically searching for a tutor or mentor can be time-consuming and may not yield the desired 
results. When searching for a tutor or mentor in person, it can be difficult to verify the 
qualifications and background of the individual, increasing the risk of working with someone 
who is not qualified or trustworthy. Physically searching for a tutor or mentor can be 
inconvenient, especially for busy individuals who have limited time to devote to the search 
process.
To resolve these kinds of problems we are going to develop a web portal which is a solution of 
above-mentioned problems.

                     Proposed System:
               
The Tutor Sphere portal provides students with access to a large pool of qualified tutors and 
mentors and to make the process of finding the right support as simple and convenient as 
possible. The platform also provides an opportunity for tutors and mentors to reach a wider 
audience and grow their businesses, while making a positive impact on the lives of students.
In this portal all tutors and mentors of different domains will get registered to show case their 
skill and qualifications. Any individual can search them fix meeting with them for further 
actions. Users can give reviews and ratings for the tutors and mentors. Tutors and mentors can 
upload videos and article according to their need.

                     Objective and Scope:
               
• To put all tutors and mentors in a single roof
• Best utilization of professionals 
• Spread awareness about new skills and technology
• Help in employment
• User friendly interface.
• Easy searching for tutors and mentors.
• Global accessibility of tutors and mentors

                   Limitations and Future Scope:
While Tutor Sphere can be a useful tool for students, there are some limitations to consider: The 
portal may not guarantee the quality of the tutors and mentors listed on the platform, so 
students may still need to do their own research to verify the qualifications and background of 
their potential tutor or mentor. The information and profiles listed on the platform may not 
always be accurate or up-to-date, as the platform relies on users to provide the information. In 
future these limitations can be overcome.

                          Conclusion:
Tutor Sphere can have a positive impact on the education sector by providing students with 
access to a large pool of qualified tutors and mentors. By making the process of finding the right 
support simple and convenient, the portal can help students achieve their goals and improve 
their educational outcomes
